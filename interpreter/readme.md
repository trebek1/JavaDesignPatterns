Intrpreter Pattern
-- Interpreter pattern is normally ignored

-- Convert one representation of data into another 
-- Context - info to be interpreted
-- Expression is an abstract class that defines all methods
needed to perform the different conversions 
-- The terminal or concrete expression provides specific
conversions on different types of data 

-- create an abstract class with all the possible types
-- extend each into its own concrete class with the conversions
-- have one class that sets up the question
-- have another that takes in input and converts it and displays to screen
