Mediator Design Pattern
-- Handle communication between related objects (colleagues)
-- All communication handled by mediator 
-- Colleagues dont know anything about each other 
-- GOF: Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way 
disparate sets of objects interact and communicate with each other 
-- allows the actions of each object set to vary independently of each other
